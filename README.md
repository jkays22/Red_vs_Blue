# Red_vs_Blue
I will work on a Red Team vs. Blue Team scenario in which I will play the role of both pentester and SOC analyst.
As the Red Team, I will attack a vulnerable VM within your environment, ultimately gaining root access to the machine. As Blue Team, I will use Kibana to review logs taken during their Day 1 engagement. I'll use the logs to extract hard data and visualizations for their report.

Then, I will interpret my log data to suggest mitigation measures for each exploit that I've successfully performed.
I will apply knowledge of the following skills and tools:

Penetration testing with Kali Linux.

Log and incident analysis with Kibana.

System hardening and configuration.

Reporting, documentation, and communication.
